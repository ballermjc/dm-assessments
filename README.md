<h1>Competencies</h1>

Competencies will be demoed and assessed throughout the cohort. A map of the current plan can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SrbTzQdwkpuuzpOryp1dnKq21rdwCbFST3gV_oCnujc/edit#gid=422070687), in the "Competency + Assessment Map" tab.


## Demos

Demos will be done on simulation days. They will cover "big picture" - can the student build an app? With full functionality? While most of the demos are required, there are several that we deemed optional. Required skills must be demoed and passed off to badge; optional is for the student to push themselves.


## Assessments

Assessments will be done on assessment days (typically Friday afternoons). They test more detailed, technical abilities, largely JavaScript, and have been broken down to bite-sized chunks. The longest assessments should take roughly minutes; this will allow students to push through several in an afternoon and feel motivated.


## Setting Expectations

This is incredibly important. Mentors must set expectations with all students before they do the competencies - it would not hurt to reset these expectations each sim day / assessment day.

1. THIS IS NOT A TEST. Make sure that the students understand that they are NOT being tested; these are merely checks to ensure they are competent in certain areas so that we can ultimately endorse them as a developer with a badge. 

2. YOU CANNOT LOSE POINTS. Assessments and competencies are not starting at 100, and losing points off of everything wrong. They start at 0, and add points as you accomplish something. There is a certain requirement of passing all required competencies, but you cannot lose points - you can only keep building your skills and prove that you can demonstrate your skill in more and more areas of web development.

3. IT'S OK TO NEED A BREAK OR MORE TIME TO STUDY. If you are struggling, it's OK for mentors to take some students to do remedial reviews instead of passing competencies, at the mentor's discretion.

4. THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING YOU UP, NOT CUTTING YOU DOWN. To reiterate #1 and #2, this is not an evaluation of your skills where you will be judged as "passing" or "failing". These competencies are about you demonstrating your growth and abilities up to the point where you are given a badge. If you can't pass off one today, you aren't failing - you just haven't built up your skills enough in that area yet. 


## Process

Demos - occurring on simulation days. Mentors <em>must walk around to and check off competencies for each of their assigned students 3x for each students</em>. This keeps the students motivated and feeling like they are accomplishing goals! Many of them will pass a competency without realizing it, or be very close to passing one, so be thorough. Ask them which ones they believe that have passed, but also check for any they have unconsciously passed.

Assessments - occurring mainly on Fridays in the second half of the course. Assessments are sets of JS problems with a Jasmine spec runner. TBD forms of distribution.
