<h1>Competencies</h1>

Competencies will be demoed and assessed throughout the cohort. A map of the current plan can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SrbTzQdwkpuuzpOryp1dnKq21rdwCbFST3gV_oCnujc/edit#gid=422070687), in the "Competency + Assessment Map" tab.


## Demos

Demos will be done on simulation days. They will cover "big picture" - can the student build an app? With full functionality? While most of the demos are required, there are several that we deemed optional. Required skills must be demoed and passed off to badge; optional is for the student to push themselves in certain areas, and <strong>they must choose five to pass off</strong>.


## Assessments

Assessments will be done on assessment days (typically Friday afternoons). They test more detailed, technical abilities, largely JavaScript, and have been broken down to bite-sized chunks. The longest assessments should take roughly minutes; this will allow students to push through several in an afternoon and feel motivated.


## Setting Expectations

This is incredibly important. Mentors must set expectations with all students before they do the competencies - it would not hurt to reset these expectations each sim day / assessment day.

1. <strong>THIS IS NOT A TEST.</strong> Make sure that the students understand that they are NOT being tested; these are merely checks to ensure they are competent in certain areas so that we can ultimately endorse them as a developer with a badge. 

2. <strong>YOU CANNOT LOSE POINTS.</strong> Assessments and competencies are not starting at 100, and losing points off of everything wrong. They start at 0, and add points as you accomplish something. There is a certain requirement of passing all required competencies, but you cannot lose points - you can only keep building your skills and prove that you can demonstrate your skill in more and more areas of web development.

3. <strong>IT'S OK TO NEED A BREAK OR MORE TIME TO STUDY.</strong> If you are struggling, it's OK for mentors to take some students to do remedial reviews instead of passing competencies, at the mentor's discretion.

4. <strong>THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING YOU UP, NOT CUTTING YOU DOWN.</strong> To reiterate #1 and #2, this is not an evaluation of your skills where you will be judged as "passing" or "failing". These competencies are about you demonstrating your growth and abilities up to the point where you are given a badge. If you can't pass off one today, you aren't failing - you just haven't built up your skills enough in that area yet. 


## Process

### Demos 
Occurring on simulation days. Mentors <strong>must walk around to and check off competencies for each of their assigned students 3x for each students</strong>. This keeps the students motivated and feeling like they are accomplishing goals! Many of them will pass a competency without realizing it, or be very close to passing one, so be thorough. Go through the categories of competenices and asked them if they've worked in that area.  

IE - 'Have you done any react? You have, cool, what have you done?  Let's look at the list.  Oh look, you're pretty close to this one I think you should try and check that one off next, and it looks like you've got this one, let's check it off.' 

Mentors should be encouraged to err on the side of leniency.  If they feel a student gets the concepts but made a small mistake and understands why, they should get credit.  Demos are not assessments, they're big picture stuff.  We'll get picky with other competencies later.  We want students to feel rewarded and encouraged to build real things.

### Assessments
Occurring mainly on Fridays in the second half of the course. Assessments are sets of JS problems with a Jasmine spec runner. TBD forms of distribution.

## Testing Scheduling - CURRENT THOUGHTS

#### Internal Pacing Notes

So far off of testing students should be averaging 6-10 competencies after an entire friday of coding.  

This gives 5 full days (weeks 3,4,5 and 2 days on the last week) + 6 afternoons.
that totals 64 total in-class hours to work on this.
If students are getting 10 competencies a week on demos that should take the 40 hours.
Assessments are scoped to take 5.5 hours. 
That should give student 20 or so extra hours of padding or almost 50% extra time to meet the requirements to badge.

* Students can work on demos weeks 3-5 and are encouraged to attempt their first assessments week 6.
* Students should be encouraged to utilize interim week days to 'catch' up if they're behind.

These repos are available for students to use for additional days to work on passing of demo competencies.
